          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Technological Advancements in Emergency Management</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-white mb-6">
            In the past, emergency response times were often delayed due to inefficient communication systems, lack of real-time data, and poor coordination. However, with the integration of mobile applications, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, emergency management has entered a new era of speed and precision. These technologies allow first responders to receive instant updates, track emergency situations in real-time, and make informed decisions more quickly.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-white mb-6">
            For instance, applications like <Link href="https://www.fema.gov/" className="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 transition-colors duration-200">FEMA</Link> (Federal Emergency Management Agency) are transforming the way emergencies are handled in the United States. These tools have made it easier for citizens to report emergencies, for first responders to mobilize, and for government agencies to provide timely assistance.

        <section className="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-5s">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Case Study: The Role of Real-Time Reporting</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-white mb-6">
            A perfect example of this technological shift is the <span className="font-bold text-blue-400">COVID-19 pandemic</span>, where real-time data was critical in responding to the crisis. Governments around the world utilized digital platforms to track the spread of the virus, collect data on the number of cases, and provide real-time updates to the public.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-white mb-6">
            Countries like South Korea and Taiwan used digital tools to manage quarantine and track patient locations. These data-driven approaches allowed for better-informed decisions, reducing the spread of the virus and saving countless lives.

        {/* Future of Emergency Management Section */}
        <section className="animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-6s">
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">The Future of Emergency Management</h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-white mb-6">
            Looking ahead, the future of emergency management lies in even more advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These technologies have the potential to predict and prevent emergencies before they occur, allowing for preemptive action. AI-powered systems can analyze patterns in data to identify emerging risks, while autonomous drones and robots can be deployed to assess situations in real-time without endangering human lives.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-white mb-6">
            In addition to AI, blockchain technology is also gaining attention for its ability to provide secure and transparent records of emergency responses. Imagine a system where all emergency transactions are securely logged on a blockchain, allowing for accountability and efficient management.
